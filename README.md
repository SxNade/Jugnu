`Jugnu is a Keylogger that can steal key-strokes and then send them through email.`

# HOW IT WORKS

**All the looged key strikes are stored and then sent after a specific amount of time**

# RUN THE KEYLOGGER

`python3 fuck_key.py`

# MORE_INFO

*Before running the keylogger you need to edit the fuck_key.py file and replace the username and password with the email ID which you choose to send KEY-Strokes to*

**YOU MAY EVEN WANT TO EDIT THE TIME BETWEEN CONSECUTIVE SENDS......BY DEFAULT IT IS SET TO 2 min**
